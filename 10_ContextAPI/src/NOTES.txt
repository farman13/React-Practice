***Before moving to context api we have to know what is props drilling . As context api is used to solve the porblem 
of props drilling.

**Props drilling**
It occurs when you need to pass data(props) from a higher-level component down to a lower-level component
that is several layers deep in the component tree. This often leads to the following issues:

- **Complexity:** You may have to pass props through many intermediate components 
                   that donâ€™t use the props themselves, just to get them to the component that needs them.
- **Maintenance:** It can make the code harder to maintain, as changes in the props structure require 
                   updates in multiple components.

** Context API :
The Context API is a powerful feature in React that enables you to manage state across your application 
more effectively, especially when dealing with deeply nested components.

The Context API provides a way to share values (states, functions, etc.) between components
without passing the props down manually at every level.
It must be created in a different file or outside the component.
### Jargon
- **Context**: This is created using React createContext(). 
              It serves as a container for the data you want to share.
- **Provider**: This component wraps part of your application and provides the context value to all its descendants. 
                Any component that is a child of this Provider can access the context.
- **Consumer**: This component subscribes to context changes. It allows you to access the context value
                (using `useContext hook)
