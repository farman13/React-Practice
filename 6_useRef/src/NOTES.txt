* useRef - It provides a way to create a reference for the "dom element" or a "value".
         so , For doing changes on a particular element(tag) we just create a reference of it
          and do perform the changes on that reference.
          also moslty in case of reference of a  "value" if u change the value, the component doesnt re-renders.
          but if we use useState to create that value then the componentre-renders when value changes.
          - useRef doesnot changes even if the component re-renders.

* so there are three ways to create a variable in react :

1. let value = 0; // rarely used , its value is reset when the component is re-renders.(thats why we use useRef)
2. const [value , setValue] = useState(0);  // for those variables we want to re-render whenever its value changes.
3. const value = useRef(0); // for those variables which we dont want to show on the page , and dont want to re-render components when its value changes.
