* SPA - It is a type of application which dont reload the page when we navigate through different routes.
      that means it doesnot request the server when we navigates. 

* To create single page applications first install the package "react-router-dom".

* After wrapping the routes inside BrowserRouter , until this point the webapp is not spa . 
  we have to use Link(Component) or useNavigate (hook) to make it SPA . 
  if we use <a> tags then its not a SPA anymore.

  - BrowserRouter: A router that uses the HTML5 history API to keep your UI in sync with the URL.
  - Route: Defines a path and the component that should be rendered when the path is matched.
  - Link can only used inside the BrowserRouter bcoz BrowserRouter provides some mechanism to navigate between different routes.
* Mostly we use Link tags for navigation.

* If user goes to a route which is not exist , for that we create a custom error page and for that 
  we create a route with path='*' . and render our custom error component.

* Layouts - It is used to divide our page into sections like header then "main content" then footer.
            For this we use outlet component to render the "main content" inside the component
            we created for Layouting.
            layout route - Jis bhi route pr jyga uske component ko render kr dega outlet component.
            Basically Outlet component just render the children .
