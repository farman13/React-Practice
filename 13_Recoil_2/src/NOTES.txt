In this we create the linkedIn top bar using recoil.

why recoil atoms over normal useState?
 - solves props drilling without need of context api .
 - minimizes re-renders without need of memo.

* Hooks in recoil :
  1. useRecoilValue = gives(subscribes) the atoms , selectors value only.
  2. useSetRecoilState = gives the setter function for atoms.
  3. useRecoilState = gives both value & settle function.
