1. If a state variable inside a component is changes then the component is re-render and  'all its childrens also
are re-render'.

2. memo hook/Api is used to memorize the children components/any component ,that you only re-renders when your state 
variables/props are changing.

another syntax : const memorizeComponent = memo(component);
                now inplace of that component write memorizeComponent.
