Custom hooks are the functions whose name start with "use".
it inside the hood uses inbuild hooks like useState , useEffect.

Custom hooks in React are a powerful feature that allows you to encapsulate and reuse stateful logic
across different components. They are essentially JavaScript functions that can use React hooks internally. 
By creating custom hooks, you can abstract away complex logic, making your components cleaner and more manageable.

### Why Use Custom Hooks?

1. **Reusability**: If you find yourself using the same logic in multiple components, 
                    a custom hook can help you avoid code duplication.
2. **Separation of Concerns**: They allow you to separate business logic from UI logic, 
                             making your components more focused and easier to understand.
